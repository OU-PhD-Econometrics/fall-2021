I gratefully acknowledge Esteban Aucejo for sharing his slides on factor models, some of which I incorporated in what follows.

I also based some content on Shalizi (2019) which is an excellent textbook on data analysis.

# Proxy variables

- Suppose we have a simple linear regression model

`\begin{align*}
y &amp;= X\beta + \varepsilon
\end{align*}`

- If `\((y,X)\)` come from observational data, the model is likely confounded

- That is, our OLS estimate of `\(\hat{\beta}\)` would be biased (because `\(X\)` is correlated with `\(\varepsilon\)`)

- One potential way to remove the bias is to include a .hi[proxy variable]

- This is a variable that we can observe and that is related to something in `\(\varepsilon\)`

- Example: unobserved ability biases returns to schooling. IQ might be a viable proxy


---
# A brief review of measurement error

- What if our proxy is measured with error? This can cause econometric problems

- In linear regression, under "classical measurement error" (CEV) assumption:

    - OLS estimates are attenuated to zero (i.e. "attenuation bias")
    
    - OLS t-stats are biased downwards

- There are other "non-classical" forms of measurement error as well

- See Pischke (2007) for a good treatment of ME

- Naturally, measurement error is a beast in non-linear models

- See Chen, Hong, and Nekipelov (2011) for a complete treatment

---
# Proxy variables &amp; measurement error

- Unless they happen to resolve the endogeneity problem, proxy variables won't work

- (Need `\(\mathbb{E}\left(\varepsilon \vert X, proxy\right) = \mathbb{E}\left(\varepsilon \vert proxy\right)\)`)

- And usually proxies don't satisfy this requirement

- You can use instrumental variables to solve the ME problem

- But only in linear models

- And, of course, instrument validity is almost always in question

- So it seems you have to choose between omitted variable bias and attenuation bias

---
# What if we have many correlated proxies?

- For the unobserved ability question, we might have many different proxies

- e.g. individuals might take multiple standardized tests

- How do we know which test scores to attempt to use as proxies?

- What if each test itself suffers from measurement error?

- What if the test scores are highly correlated with each other?

- Today we'll talk about how to handle this situation

- The application focuses on measuring ability

- But this approach is generally applicable when we have many noisy measurements

---
# Dimensionality reduction

- .hi[Dimensionality reduction] is a common task in data analysis

- If 3 variables all give the same information, why not just have 1?

- There are two related methods for reducing dimensionality

1. .hi[Principle Components Analysis (PCA)]

2. .hi[Factor Analysis]

---
# PCA

- PCA is one way to reduce dimensionality. Let `\(M\)` be an `\(N\times J\)` matrix of data

- Decompose `\(M\)` as follows:
`\begin{align*}
M &amp;= \boldsymbol{\theta}\Lambda\\
[N\times J] &amp;= [N\times J] [J\times J]
\end{align*}`

- `\(\Lambda\)` are stacked eigenvectors

- `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` is an .hi[orthogonalized transformation] of `\(M\)` (columns of `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` are uncorrelated)

- `\(\Lambda\)` indicates the rotation angle to get from `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` back to `\(M\)`

- If `\(M\)` were orthogonal to begin with, `\(\Lambda = I\)` and `\(M=\boldsymbol{\theta}\)`


---
# PCA 2

- Nothing on the previous slide helps us with dimensionality reduction per se

- We reduce dimensionality by choosing the eigenvectors with the largest magnitudes

- These represent the dimensions `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` with the greatest variance

- We say that we "select the first `\(K\)` .hi[principal components] of `\(M\)`"

- Mathematically, we "reduce" (i.e. "approximate") `\(M\)` by choosing a subset of `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` and `\(\Lambda\)`

`\begin{align*}
\widetilde{M} &amp;= \boldsymbol{\theta}_k\Lambda_k\\
[N\times J] &amp;= [N\times K] [K\times J]\\
&amp;\\
M &amp;= \boldsymbol{\theta}_k\Lambda_k + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{align*}`
where `\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\equiv M - \widetilde{M}\)` is a `\(N\times J\)` matrix


---

# Factor Analysis

- Factor Analysis comes in two forms: Exploratory (EFA) and Confirmatory (CFA)
    
    - EFA: see what factors might be in the data
    
    - CFA: write down a model and use the data to test it

- In economics, we pretty much only do CFA

- FA is used extensively in psychometrics

- It is a natural tool for analyzing cognitive or behavioral tests

    - Each test measures some set of skills, but does so noisily
    
    - Tests tend to measure the same set of skills, so they are correlated

---
# How factor analysis works

- Suppose our `\(J\)` columns of `\(M\)` correspond to measurements (e.g. test scores)

- FA tries to find some underlying unobservables that commonly affect `\(M\)`

- We assume that we cannot observe `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)`

- If we assume that `\(M\)` is standardized (mean-zero, unit-variance), then

`\begin{align*}
M &amp;= \underbrace{\boldsymbol{\theta}_k\Lambda_k + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_{\boldsymbol{u}}
\end{align*}`

- `\(u\)` is a composite error term (since both `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` and `\(\varepsilon\)` are unobservable)

- In FA, we call `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` .hi[factors], and we call `\(\Lambda\)` .hi[factor loadings] and `\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\)` .hi[uniquenesses]


---
# PCA vs. FA

- Clearly, PCA and FA are related, but there are important differences

- The `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}_k\)` we get from PCA and FA are going to be different

- But the `\(\Lambda_k\)` are identical (and hence the `\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\)` are different)

- `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}_k^{PCA}\)` has larger variance than `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}_k^{FA}\)`

- This is because PCA treats `\(M\)` as not measured with error, but FA does the opposite

- For many more excellent details, see Shalizi (2019)  [here](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch19.pdf)

---
# Extensions of FA

- We can extend FA to allow for `\(X\)`'s that affect our measurements

`\begin{align*}
M &amp;= X\boldsymbol{\beta} + \underbrace{\boldsymbol{\theta}_k\Lambda_k + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_{\boldsymbol{u}} \\
[N\times J] &amp;= [N\times L] [L\times J] + [N\times K] [K\times J] + [N\times J]
\end{align*}`

- If `\(X\)` is `\(N\times L\)` then `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` is a `\(L\times J\)` matrix

- However, we do need to make more assumptions for econometric identification!

---
# Identifying assumptions for a 2-factor model

- We need to make the following assumptions:

`\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right) &amp;= \mathbf{0}_{J\times 1}\\
\mathbb{V}\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right) &amp;\equiv \mathbb{E}\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}'\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right)=\Omega_{J\times J}\\
\Omega_{[j,j]} &amp;= \sigma^2_j, \Omega_{[j,k]} = 0\\
\mathbb{E}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right) &amp;= \mathbf{0}_{2\times 1}\\
\mathbb{V}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right) &amp;= \Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta}
\end{align*}`

- Let `\(u \equiv M - X\boldsymbol{\beta}\)`, then
`\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left(u\right) &amp;= \mathbf{0}_{J\times 1}\\
\mathbb{V}\left(u\right) &amp;= \Lambda\Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta}\Lambda' + \Omega\\
\Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta} &amp;= \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma^2_{\theta_1} &amp; \sigma_{\theta_1 \theta_2}\\
\sigma_{\theta_1 \theta_2} &amp; \sigma^2_{\theta_2}\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}`

---
# Identification of a 2-factor model

- Our only data source to estimate `\(\Lambda\)` and `\(\Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` is `\(\mathbb{V}\left(M-X\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)\equiv \mathbb{V}\left(u\right)\)`

- Let's look at the variance-covariance matrix of `\(u\)`:

    - This has `\(J\)` diagonal elements and `\(\frac{J(J-1)}{2}\)` unique off-diagonal elements

- With these `\(J+\frac{J(J-1)}{2}\)` moments in the data, we want to estimate:
    - The `\(J\)` diagonal elements of `\(\Omega\)` (i.e. the `\(\sigma^2_j\)`'s)
    - `\(2J\)` elements of `\(\Lambda\)`
    - four elements of `\(\Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta}\)`

- We have `\(3J+4\)` parameters, but only `\(J+\frac{J(J-1)}{2}\)` data moments

- In general, the model is not identified. We will need to impose further assumptions.


---
# Additional identifying assumptions

- The following are common assumptions, but you could impose others

1. `\(\theta_1 \perp \theta_2\)` (so `\(\Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` is diagonal)

2. The scale of each factor is arbitrary. 2 ways to normalize the scale:
    - `\(\Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta} = I_{2\times 2}\)`
    - or
    - Set one element of each row of `\(\Lambda=1\)`
    
- With these two assumptions, we achieve identification if

`\begin{align*}
2J + J \leq J+\frac{J(J-1)}{2}
\end{align*}`

- So `\(J\geq 5\)` is necessary (but not sufficient) for identification



---
# Other identification considerations

- For .hi[model interpretability], also need to put more structure on `\(\Lambda\)`

- For example, suppose we have 6 measurements: 
    - 3 from a cognitive test and 3 from a personality test

- In this case, the first row of `\(\Lambda\)` should be 0 for the personality measures

- Likewise, the second row of `\(\Lambda\)` should be 0 for the cognitive measures

- If all 6 measurements come from a cog. test, can't identify a non-cog. factor

- Could possibly identify `\(\sigma_{\theta_1\theta_2}\)` if one measurement measures both factors


---
# Estimation of factor models

- Typically, we impose distributional assumptions on `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\)`

- e.g. assume `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\)` are each MVN with 0 covariance and `\(\boldsymbol{\theta} \perp \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\)`

- Then we estimate `\((\Lambda, \Sigma_\boldsymbol{\theta}, \Omega)\)` by maximum likelihood

- The likelihood function will need to be integrated, since `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` is unobserved

- Can use quadrature, simulated method of moments, MCMC, or the EM algorithm

    - As you know, these vary in their ease of use


---
# Using factor models to `\(\downarrow\)` bias of regression estimates

- The whole reason we use a factor model is to reduce bias

- Let's go back to the log wage example from the start of today

    - `\(\beta\)`'s are biased if we omit cognitive ability (omitted variable bias)
    
    - `\(\beta\)`'s are also biased if we include IQ score (attenuation bias from meas. err.)

- We know cognitive ability affects wages, and we have (noisy) measurements of it

- We can estimate the log wage parameters by maximum likelihood

- We combine together the log wage and factor model likelihoods

- I'll walk you through how to do this in the Problem Set (due next time)

---
# Factor models and dynamic selection

- Factor models can also be used to account for dynamic selection

- Intuition: `\(\uparrow\)` cog. abil `\(\Rightarrow \uparrow\)` schooling `\(\Rightarrow \uparrow\)` wages

- Schooling is endogenous, so we can add a schooling choice model to our likelihood

- When the ability factor enters choice of schooling, this induces a correlation between schooling choices and wages

- But conditional on the factor, we have separability of the likelihood components

- `\(\mathcal{L} = \int_A \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_1(A)}_{\text{measurements}}\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_2(A)}_{\text{choices}}\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_3(A)}_{\text{wages}} dF(A)\)`

- We covered a variant of this case back when we discussed Mixed Logit
